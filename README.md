# Filter-Identification-Using-Convolution-Correlation
Identify the type of filtering applied to an input signal using convolution and correlation. This project implements Low Pass, High Pass, and Band Pass filters, compares their filtered outputs with the given output signal, and determines the best-matched filter.

This repository contains code for a project on signal processing and systems analysis. The project focuses on identifying the type of filtering applied to an input signal to produce a given output signal. Three types of filters are implemented: Low Pass, High Pass, and Band Pass. The methodology involves convolving each filter with the input signal to obtain filtered outputs, and then comparing these outputs with the given output signal using correlation.

## Features

- Implementation of Low Pass, High Pass, and Band Pass filters.
- Convolution of filters with input signal to obtain filtered outputs.
- Correlation-based comparison between filtered outputs and given output signal.
