# Filter-Identification-Using-Convolution-Correlation
Identify the type of filtering applied to an input signal using convolution and correlation. This project implements Low Pass, High Pass, and Band Pass filters, compares their filtered outputs with the given output signal, and determines the best-matched filter.
